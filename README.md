# GHO

https://github.com/AntalDaniel-Rares/GHO

GHO is a small game that I am currently working on. The original idea was to develop a game based on the Chinese board game Go which according to Wikipedia "is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day". As I was going further and further in the development process, GHO transformed in something that can not really be associated with the original idea.

It was a super fun project that I worked on by myself, I learned a lot about the C# programming language and various notions such as multi-threading and the .NET environment. As I said, the game is not finished yet, but I provided a link where anyone can download the game.

You can acces the entire project in the GHO folder, but if you just want to play the game run the .exe file.
